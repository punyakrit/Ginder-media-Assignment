## Backend Technologies

- **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (jsonwebtoken)
- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs
- **Middleware**: body-parser, cors
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Schema Validation**: zod

These backend technologies are utilized to build a secure, efficient, and scalable backend for the project. Express.js serves as the foundation for handling routing and middleware, while JSON Web Tokens and bcryptjs ensure secure authentication and password hashing. Middleware like body-parser and cors enhance request handling and security. MySQL is used as the database management system for storing and retrieving data, and zod provides schema validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.

## Frontend Dependencies

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: Declarative routing for React applications, enabling dynamic navigation and routing.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API, simplifying data fetching and handling asynchronous operations.
- **React Icons**: Provides a collection of popular icon libraries for use in the project's UI components, enhancing visual appeal and user experience.

These frontend dependencies are crucial for building the user interface and handling client-side logic in the project. React and React DOM are core libraries for building user interfaces in React applications. React Router DOM is used for declarative routing, and Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API. React Icons provides a collection of popular icon libraries for use in UI components, enhancing visual appeal and user experience.
